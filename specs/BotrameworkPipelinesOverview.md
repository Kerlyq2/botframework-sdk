Most pipelines for building and releasing Bot Framework products are on the [Azure FuseLabs web site](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/).

Building and testing packages is done using Azure Pipelines. [Example](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/SDK_v4/_build?view=folders).

Deploying and releasing packages is done using Azure Release Pipelines. [Example](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/SDK_v4/_release?_a=releases&view=all&path=%5C).
